# Othello
Classic Othello game with customization, local multiplayer, and a simple AI opponent. 

One of the main points was to try and build a game with a fully customizable board. The game engine supports all possible board sized. Only restriction is that rows and columns must be multiples of 2. 

The AI engine also works equally well with all possible board sizes. AI has two different strategies, but for now, the selection is predefined in the code.
